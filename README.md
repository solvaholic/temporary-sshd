How do you think it'd be to have a service where a user could go to a web page and request a dummy server for 30min or so?

"I want to isolate this SSH/HTTP/whatever access issue"

Go to https://not-my.services and request a SSH/HTTP/whatever server to test connectivity. Service spins up a prefab container with appropriate config and access policies. Web page provides instructions for testing.

Maybe it already exists?
